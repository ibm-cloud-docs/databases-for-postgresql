# Managing PostgreSQL extensions
{: #extensions}

In PostgreSQL, extensions are modules that supply extra functions, operators, or types. Many extensions are available in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}}. To use them, [set the admin password](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-user-management&interface=ui#user-management-set-admin-password-ui) for your service and use it to [connect with `psql`](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-connecting-psql).

## Listing installed extensions
{: #listing-installed-extensions}

Get a list of all the extensions installed on a database by using the `\dx` command.

For example, the output for `\dx` when run on the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} default database shows the only installed extension.

```sh
ibmclouddb=> \dx
                 List of installed extensions
  Name   | Version |   Schema   |         Description
---------+---------+------------+------------------------------
 plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(1 row)
```

## Installing extensions
{: #installing-extensions}

To install an extension on to a database use [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html){: .external}. For example, to install `pg_stat_statements` on the `ibmclouddb` database, use the following command:

```sh
ibmclouddb=> CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION
```
{: pre}

Extensions are installed into the read-only `ibm_extension` schema. The schema is part of the `search_path` so extension objects do not need to be qualified with a schema.
The change from `public` schema to `ibm_extension` schema is necessary to protect the security and integrity of your data.

If you run the `\dx` command after installing an extension, it appears in the table.

```sh
ibmclouddb=> \dx
                                     List of installed extensions
        Name        | Version |   Schema      |                        Description
--------------------+---------+---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
 pg_stat_statements | 1.5     | ibm_extension | track execution statistics of all SQL statements executed
 plpgsql            | 1.0     | pg_catalog    | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(2 rows)
```

Database extensions in PostgreSQL are managed per database. If you have multiple databases that you need to install an extension on, run the `CREATE` command on each database.

## Upgrading extensions
{: #upgrading-extensions}

If there is a newer version of an extension available than the one you currently have installed, use the `ALTER EXTENSION` to upgrade it.

## Extension-specific notes
{: #extensions-specific-notes}

### pg_repack
{: #pg_repack}

- [The `pg_repack` documentation](http://reorg.github.io/pg_repack/){: .external}
- When you run the `pg_repack` command, pass the -k flag in to bypass the check for superuser. See the following example:

   ```sh
   pg_repack -k [OPTION]... [DBNAME]
   ```
   {: pre}

- For `pg_repack` to run reliably, your deployment should be on PostgreSQL 9.6 and above.
- Any user can run `pg_repack`, but the command is only able to repack a table that they have permissions on.
- `pg_repack` needs to take an exclusive lock on objects it is reorganizing at the end of the reorganization. If it can't get this lock after a certain period, it cancels all conflicting queries. If it can't do so, the reorg fails. By default, only the admin user on PostgreSQL 9.6 and greater is able to cancel conflicting queries. To expose the ability to cancel queries to other database users, grant the `pg_signal_backend` role [from the admin user](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-user-management#the-admin-user).


### pgaudit
{: #pgaudit}

- `pgaudit` libraries are preloaded and do not require execution of `create extension pgaudit`. For more information, see [Logging with pgAudit](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-pgaudit) to enable pgaudit logs. 


### pgvector
{: #pgvector}

-  To add the `pgvector` extension to your deployment, use the `create extension vector` command.
-  Important: `pgvector` requires PostgreSQL version 15 or higher.


## Available extensions
{: #available-extensions}

See the following list of all available extensions. For a list of available extensions on your deployment, use `SELECT name FROM pg_available_extensions;` in `psql`.

```sh
ibmclouddb=> SELECT name FROM pg_available_extensions order by 1;
```
{: pre}

```sh
             name
