# Enabling ICU Support
{: #enabling-pgicu}
[ICU](http://site.icu-project.org/) (International Components for Unicode) uses C/C++ and Java libraries to provide Unicode and Globalization internationalization and localization facilities, including collation. ICU provides stability to your database by index corruption due to OS collation changes.
