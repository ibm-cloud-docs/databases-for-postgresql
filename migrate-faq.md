# Migrating a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} to another region
{: #postgresql-migrate-region}

Migrating an {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} instance to a different region with minimal or no downtime requires careful planning and execution. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

## Assess your requirements
{: #postgresql-migrate-region-requirements}

Determine the reasons for migrating to a different region, such as better performance, compliance, or disaster recovery. Consider the impact on latency, network connectivity, and any regulatory requirements.

## Choose the target region
{: #postgresql-migrate-region-target-region}

Select the region where you want to migrate your PostgreSQL instance. Consider factors such as availability, proximity to your users, and compliance with data protection regulations.

## Prepare the target environment
{: #postgresql-migrate-region-environ}

Set up the necessary infrastructure and resources in the target region, including a new PostgreSQL instance or a compatible database service.

## Configure Read-only Replicas
{: #postgresql-migrate-replication}

Set up your IBM CloudÂ® Databases for PostgreSQL deployment to be a read-only replica of another Databases for PostgreSQL deployment. Replication ensures that data changes are continuously propagated from the source to the target instance.

For more information, see [Configuring Read-only Replicas](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-read-only-replicas).

When you create the replica, you must allocate sufficient disk space for all the data. [Autoscaling](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-autoscaling&interface=cli) won't run until after your deployment is fully provisioned and the data is in sync.

## Initiate the migration 
{: #postgresql-migrate-region-migration}

Once the replication and backup mechanisms are in place, you can start the migration process. This involves synchronizing the data from the source instance to the target instance while minimizing downtime.

Begin by stopping all write operations on the source PostgreSQL instance. This can be achieved by placing the database in read-only mode or by redirecting application traffic to a maintenance page.

Capture any remaining changes made to the source database and replicate them to the target instance using the established replication mechanism.

Update your application's connection string or DNS settings to point to the new target PostgreSQL instance.

Conduct thorough testing to ensure that your application is functioning correctly with the migrated database.

## Switch over to the target instance
{: #postgresql-migrate-region-switch-target}

Once you have verified the functionality of the migrated database and are confident in its stability, you can proceed with the switchover.

Update the necessary DNS records or application configurations to direct traffic to the target instance.

Monitor the traffic and ensure that it is successfully redirected to the target instance.

If required, disable the replication between the source and target instances, and clean up any resources associated with the source instance.

## Post-migration validation
{: #postgresql-migrate-region-validate}

Perform comprehensive testing to confirm that the application is running smoothly with the migrated PostgreSQL instance. Check for data consistency, verify performance, and validate any specific requirements or compliance standards.
