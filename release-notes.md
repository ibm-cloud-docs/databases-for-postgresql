## 28 Jan 2026
{: #databases-for-postgreSQL-28Jan2026}
{: release-note}

Accelerated availability for PITR restores
:  {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} now allows customers to access database instances immediately following a primary Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) restoration. This enhancement eliminates the wait time for secondary node synchronization, allowing operations to resume faster than ever.

How it works:

* Accelerated availability: The primary node is restored and opened for traffic, while the secondary (HA) node synchronizes in the background.
* Configuration: This behavior is controlled via the new `async_restore` parameter.

Key benefits and risk considerations:

* This feature enables immediate database access following primary node restoration, significantly reducing the time required to resume operations. However, High Availability (HA) remains inactive during the initial recovery phase; if a zone failure occurs before the secondary node fully synchronizes, the instance may be exposed to potential data loss. Clients are advised to carefully evaluate these risks before enabling this feature.

For implementation guidance, see the [async_restore documentation](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-dashboard-backups&interface=cli#async_restore-pg).

## 18 Dec 2025
{: #databases-for-postgreSQL-18Dec2025}
{: release-note}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} version 18 is now available
:  If you use a previous version of {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}}, you can migrate to version 18, which is the next available version. For more information, see [Upgrading to a new Major Version](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-upgrading){: external}.

## 08 Dec 2025
{: #databases-for-postgreSQL-08Dec2025}
{: release-note}

In-place major version upgrades for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}}
:  This new capability simplifies the upgrade process and enhances operational lifecycle management for your database instances.
  * The feature is now available for PostgreSQL v14, providing a streamlined path to v15.
  * Support for additional PostgreSQL versions will be added in upcoming releases.

  This enhancement reduces upgrade complexity, minimizes downtime, and ensures a smoother transition to newer versions. Key benefits include:
  * Connection parameters retained — no reconfiguration needed after the upgrade.
  * Faster upgrade process compared to traditional methods.
  * Flexible scheduling — choose the upgrade time that best fits your workload.
  * Seamless migration from PostgreSQL v14 to v15.

  For more information, see [Upgrading to a new major version](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-upgrading).

  You can still perform major version upgrades using read-replica promote upgrade or backup and restore methods. The new in-place upgrade feature provides an additional option.
