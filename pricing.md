# Pricing for {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full_notm}} 

A {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} Standard plan deploys with as one highly available PostgreSQL cluster with two data members. Your data is replicated on both members. The Standard plan is priced based on the total amount of disk storage, RAM, and backup storage allocated to deployments, prorated hourly. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} instances have a minimum of 5GB of disk and 1GB of RAM per data member.

## Cost Breakdown

**Disk storage per data member** - gigabytes of disk allocated to a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} data member, or the size of your data.  
**RAM per data member** - gigabytes of RAM allocated to a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} data member.  
**Backup storage** - amount of storage used for backups by a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} instance. 

Resources | Breakdown | Price
-------|-------|-------
10 GB-Month disk | 2 members x 10 GB x $0.58 | $11.60
1 GB-Month RAM | 2 members x 1 GB  x $5 | $10

## Using the Pricing Calculator

For pricing estimation, input your total consumption across two data members into the calculator. This is roughly double the size of your data, because your data is replicated to both members. For example, 10GB of disk and 1GB of RAM across two data members would be priced at 20GB of disk and 2GB of RAM respectively.

## Backups Pricing

Users also receive their total disk space purchased, per database, in free backup storage. For example, in a month, if you have a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} deployment that has provisioned 10GB of disk per member, which has two data members, you receive 20GB of backup storage free for that month. If your backup storage utilization is greater than 20GB for the month in this scenario, each GB is charged at an overage $0.03/month. Most deployments will not ever go over the allotted credit.
