# Managing PostgreSQL Extensions

In PostgreSQL, extensions are modules that supply extra functions, operators, or types. Many extensions are available in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}}. In order to use them you need to [set the admin password]() for your service and [connect as an admin]() through `psql`.

## Listing Installed Extensions

Get a list of all the extensions installed on a database by using the `\dx` command.

For example, the output for `\dx` when run on the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_}} default database shows the only installed extension.
```
ibmclouddb=> \dx
                 List of installed extensions
  Name   | Version |   Schema   |         Description
---------+---------+------------+------------------------------
 plpgsql | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(1 row)
```

## Installing Extensions

To install an extension on to a database use [`CREATE EXTENSION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html). For example, to install `pg_stat_statements` on the `ibmclouddb` database, 

```
ibmclouddb=> CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

If you run the `\dx` command after installing an extension, it appears in the table.
```
ibmclouddb=> \dx
                                     List of installed extensions
        Name        | Version |   Schema   |                        Description
--------------------+---------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------
 pg_stat_statements | 1.5     | public     | track execution statistics of all SQL statements executed
 plpgsql            | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
(2 rows)
```

Database extensions in PostgreSQL are managed per database. If you have multiple databases that you need to install an extension on, you run the install command on each database.

## Upgrading Extensions

If there is a newer version of an extension available than the one you currently have installed, use the `ALTER EXTENSION` to upgrade it.
