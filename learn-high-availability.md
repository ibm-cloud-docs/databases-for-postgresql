# High-Availability
{: #high-availability}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} is a managed cloud database service that is fully integrated into the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} environment. The database, storage, and supporting infrastructure all run in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} provides replication, fail-over, and high-availability features to protect your databases and data from infrastructure maintenance, upgrades, and failures. Deployments contain a cluster with two data members, a leader and a replica. Both members contain a copy of your data by using asynchronous replication, with a distributed consensus mechanism to maintain cluster state and handle failovers. If the leader becomes unreachable, the cluster initiates a failover and the replica is promoted to leader. The replica rejoins the cluster and your cluster continues to operate normally. 

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} will, at times, do controlled switchovers under normal operation. These switchovers are no-data-loss events that result in resets of active connections. There is a period of up to 15 seconds where reconnections can fail. At times, unplanned failovers might occur due to unforeseen events on the operating environment. These can take up to 45 seconds, but can be less. In both cases, potential exists for the downtime to be longer.

You can extend high-availability further by adding [PostgreSQL members](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-horizontal-scaling) to the instance, for greater in-region redundancy, or by provisioning [read-only replicas](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-read-only-replicas) for cross-regional failover or read offloading. 

By default, streaming replication is asynchronous. If the primary server crashes then some transactions that were committed may not have been replicated to the standby server, causing data loss. The amount of data loss is proportional to the replication delay at the time of failover. {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} synchronous replication offers the ability to confirm that all changes made by a transaction have been transferred to a synchronous member, ensuring consistency across a cluster by confirming that writes are written to a secondary before returning to the connecting client with a success. For variables regarding synchronous replication, see [`synchronous_commit`](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-changing-configuration#gen-settings) on the Changing Configuration page. 

Employing synchronous replication will negatively impact the performance of the database. Typically, a performant and effective way to employ this feature is by using it only on specific databases or users within EnterpriseDB that must have the highest degree of data durability available.
{: .note}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} is designed and built to provide a robust, resilient, and performant Database as a Service offering. We highly recommend reviewing the PostgreSQL documentation on [replication techniques](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-async-commit.html) to understand the constraints and tradeoffs associated with the asynchronous replication strategy deployed by default with {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}}.

In scenarios where a database becomes critically unhealthy, such as a server crash on the leader, {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} will attempt to initiate a failover. This auto failover capability is capped at 1 MB of data lag from leader to follower (a few rows of data once accounting for additional PostgreSQL data overhead) and will not be performed if the lag threshold is exceeded. If the potential for 1 MB of data loss is intolerable for the application, you can horizontally scale your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} instance to 3 members and configure {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} to use a synchronous replication strategy on a per user or per database basis.

## Application-level High-Availability
{: #application-level-ha}

Applications that communicate over networks and cloud services are subject to transient connection failures. You want to design your applications to retry connections when errors are caused by a temporary loss in connectivity to your deployment or to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

Because {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} is a managed service, regular updates and database maintenance occurs as part of normal operations. This can occasionally cause short intervals where your database is unavailable. It can also cause the database to trigger a graceful fail-over, retry, and reconnect. It takes a short time for the database to determine which member is a replica and which is the leader, so you might also see a short connection interruption. Failovers generally take less than 30 seconds.

Your applications have to be designed to handle temporary interruptions to the database, implement error handling for failed database commands, and implement retry logic to recover from a temporary interruption.

Several minutes of database unavailability or connection interruption are not expected. Open a [support case](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/cases/add) with details if you have time periods longer than a minute with no connectivity so we can investigate.

## Connection Limits
{: #connection-limits-ha}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} sets the maximum number of connections to your PostgreSQL database to **115**. 15 connections are reserved for the superuser to maintain the state and integrity of your database, and 100 connections are available for you and your applications. After the connection limit has been reached, any attempts at starting a new connection results in an error. To prevent overwhelming your deployment with connections, use connection pooling, or scale your deployment and increase its connection limit. For more information, see the [Managing PostgreSQL Connections](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-managing-connections) page.

## High availability, disaster recovery, and SLA resources
{: #ha-recovery-sla}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} deployments conform to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Databases [HA, DR, and SLA](/docs/cloud-databases?topic=cloud-databases-ha-dr) information and terms.
