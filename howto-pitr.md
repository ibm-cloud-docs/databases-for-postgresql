# Point-in-time Recovery
{: #pitr}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} offers Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR) for any time in the last 7 days. The deployment performs continuous incremental backups and can replay transactions to bring a new deployment restored from a backup to any point in that 7 day window you need.

The _Backups_ tab of your deployment's UI keeps all your PITR information under _Point-in-Time_.

Included information is the earliest time for a PITR. 

To discover the earliest recovery point through the API, use the [`/deployments/{id}/point_in_time_recovery_data`] endpoint to find the earliest PITR time. 
```
{
    "point_in_time_recovery_data": {
        "earliest_point_in_time_recovery_time": "2019-09-09T23:16:00Z"
    }
}
```

## Recovery

Backups are restored to a new deployment. After the new deployment finishes provisioning, your data in the backup file is restored into the new deployment.

By default the new deployment is auto-sized to the same disk and memory allocation as the source deployment at the time of the backup you are restoring from. Especially in the case of PITR, that might not be the current size of your deployment. If you need to adjust the resources allocated to the new deployment, use the optional fields in the UI, CLI, or API to resize the new deployment. Be sure to allocate enough for your data and workload, if the deployment is not given enough resources the restore will fail.

It is very important that you do not delete the source deployment while the backup is restoring. You must wait until the new deployment is provisioned and the backup is restored before deleting the old deployment. Deleting a deployment also deletes its backups so not only will the restore fail, you may not be able to recover the backup either.

### In the UI

To initiate a PITR, enter the time you would like to restore back to in UTC. If you just want to restore to the most recent available time, select that option. Clicking **Restore** brings up the options for your recovery. Enter a name, select the version, region, and allocated resources for the new deployment. Click **Recover** to start the process.

If you use Key Protect and have a key, you have to use the CLI to recover and a command is provided for your convenience.

### In the CLI

The Resource Controller supports provisioning of database deployments, and provisioning and restoring are the responsibility of the Resource Controller CLI. Use the [`resource service-instance-create`](/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_instance_create) command.

For PITR, use the `point_in_time_recovery_time` and `point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id` parameters. The `point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id` is the source deployment's ID and `point_in_time_recovery_time` is the timestamp in UTC you want to restore to. If you want to restore to the latest available point-in-time use `"point_in_time_recovery_time":" "`.
```
ibmcloud resource service-instance-create <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <service-id> <region> -p '{"point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id":"DEPLOYMENT_ID", "point_in_time_recovery_time":"TIMESTAMP"}'
```

A pre-formatted command for a specific backup or PITR is available in detailed view of the backup.

Optional parameters are available when restoring through the CLI. Use them if you need to customize resources, or use a Key Protect key for BYOK encryption on the new deployment.
```
ibmcloud resource service-instance-create <SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME> <service-id> standard <region> -p
'{"point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id":"DEPLOYMENT_ID", "point_in_time_recovery_time":"TIMESTAMP","key_protect_key":"KEY_PROTECT_KEY_CRN", "members_disk_allocation_mb":"DESIRED_DISK_IN_MB", "members_memory_allocation_mb":"DESIRED_MEMORY_IN_MB", "members_cpu_allocation_count":"NUMBER_OF_CORES"}'
```

### In the API

The Resource Controller supports provisioning of database deployments, and provisioning and restoring are the responsibility of the Resource Controller API. You need to complete [the necessary steps to use the resource controller API](/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=cloud-databases-provisioning#provisioning-through-the-resource-controller-api) before you can use it to restore from a backup. 

Once you have all the information, the create request is a `POST` to the [`/resource_instances`](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/resource-controller#create-provision-a-new-resource-instance) endpoint.

```
curl -X POST \
  https://resource-controller.cloud.ibm.com/v2/resource_instances \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
    "name": "<SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME>",
    "target": "<region>",
    "resource_group": "<your-resource-group>",
    "resource_plan_id": "<service-id>"
    "point_in_time_recovery_time":"<TIMESTAMP>",
    "point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id":"<DEPLOYMENT_ID>"
  }'
```
The parameters `name`, `target`, `resource_group`, and `resource_plan_id` are all required. The `target` is the region where you want the new deployment to be located, which can be a different region from the source deployment. Cross-region restores are supported, with the exception of restoring a `eu-de` backup to another region.

For PITR, use the `point_in_time_recovery_time` and `point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id` parameters. The `point_in_time_recovery_deployment_id` is the source deployment's ID and `point_in_time_recovery_time` is the timestamp in UTC you want to restore to. If you want to restore to the latest available point-in-time use `"point_in_time_recovery_time":" "`.

If you need to adjust resources or use a Key Protect key, add the optional parameters `key_protect_key`, `members_disk_allocation_mb`, `members_memory_allocation_mb`, and/or `members_cpu_allocation_count`, and their desired values to the body of the request

## Verifying PITR

In order to verify the correct recovery time, you have to check the database logs. Checking the database logs requires the [Logging Integration](/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=cloud-databases-logging) to be set up on your deployment.

When you perform a recovery, your data is restored from the most recent incremental backup and any outstanding transactions from the WAL log are used to catch your database up to the time you recovered to. After the recovery is finished, and the transactions are run, the logs display a message. You can check that your logs have the message
```
LOG:  last completed transaction was at log time 2019-09-03 19:40:48.997696+00
```

There are two scenarios where recovery does not show up in the logs. 
1. Your deployment has a recent full backup and there is no activity after the backup was taken that needs to be replayed.
2. If you entered a time to recover to that is **after** the current time or is past latest available point-in-time recovery point.

In both cases the recovery is usually still successful, but there won't be an entry in the logs to check the exact time the database was restored to.
