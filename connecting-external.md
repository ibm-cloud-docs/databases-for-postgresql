# Connecting an external application
{: #connecting-external-app}

In order to connect an application to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}}, you will need some connection strings.


## Getting Connection Strings

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} provides connection strings specifically for drivers and applications. They contain all the relevant pieces of connection information. The _Service Credentials_ panel provides connection strings as a JSON object. 

A [table](./working-connection-strings#the-postgresql-section) with a breakdown of all the connection information.

Links to examples of drivers using connection information. Or enter code snippets here.
