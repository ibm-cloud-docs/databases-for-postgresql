# Connecting an external application
{: #connecting-external-app}

Your applications and drivers use connection strings to make a connection to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}}. The service provides connection strings specifically for drivers and applications. 

## Getting Connection Strings

The easiest way to get connection strings for an application is to create a set of _Service Credentials_ specifically for your application to connect with. Doing so also returns all the connection information as JSON in a click-to-copy field. Full documentation on generating and retrieving connection strings is on the [Getting Connection Strings](./work-with-connection-strings.html) page.

Other options for getting connection strings are through the [CLI cloud databases plug-in](./work-with-connection-strings.html#generating-connection-strings-from-the-command-line), and the [cloud databases API](https://pages.github.ibm.com/compose/apidocs/). A [table](./working-connection-strings#the-postgresql-section) with a breakdown of all the connection information is included for reference.

## Connecting with a language's driver

PostgreSQL has a vast array of language drivers. The table covers a few of the most common.

Language|Driver|Examples
----------|-----------
PHP|`pgsql`|[Link](http://php.net/manual/en/pgsql.examples-basic.php)
Ruby|`ruby-pg`|[Link](https://bitbucket.org/ged/ruby-pg/wiki/Home)
Ruby on Rails|Rails|[Rails Guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-a-postgresql-database)
Python|`Psycopg2`|[Link](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Psycopg2_Tutorial)
C#|`ODBC`|[Link](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Using_Microsoft_.NET_with_the_PostgreSQL_Database_Server_via_ODBC)
Go|`pq`|[Link](https://godoc.org/github.com/lib/pq)
Node|`node-postgres`|[Link](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/Example)

## Driver TLS and self-signed certificate support

All connections to {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql}} are TLS 1.2 enabled, so the driver you use to connect will need to be able to support encryption. Your deployment also comes with a self-signed certificate so the driver can verify the server upon connection. Most drivers will have a parameter to specify the path to a copy of the certificate you have decoded and saved locally. For more information, see [Using the self-signed certificate](./work-with-connection-strings.html#using-the-self-signed-certificate).
