# Settings

Manage your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} service through these available settings.

## Scaling Resources

The _Scale Resources_ panel shows the current size and resource allocation for your deployment. You can manage the available resources for your deployment by adjusting the groups of resources. 

Resources that are not scalable are grayed out. They are shown for informational purposes only.
{: .tip} 

**Storage** - Storage shows the amount of disk space that is allocated to your service, based on the size of your data. As you store more data in the service the amount of disk space increases automatically. Your data is replicated across two data containers in the PostgreSQL cluster, so the amount of space your usage reflects is roughly twice the size of your data. 

**Memory** - If you find that your queries and database activity suffer from performance issues due to a lack of memory, you can scale the amount of RAM allocated to your service. Your PostgreSQL deployment runs with two containers in a cluster, so the amount of memory you add is added to both containers. 

Scaling operations can cause downtime. When the scaling is complete the Deployment Details pane updates to show the current usage and the new values for the available storage and memory. 

Billing is based on the _total_ amount of resources that are allocated to the service.

### Scaling via the UI

Adjust the slider to increase or decrease the resources that are allocated to your service. Click **Scale** to trigger the scaling operations and return to the dashboard overview.

### Scaling via the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI cloud databases plug-in

Use the command `cdb deployment-groups` to see current resource information for your service, including which resource groups are adjustable. To scale any of the available resource groups, use `cdb deployment-groups-set` command. 

For example, to view the resource groups for a deployment named "example-deployment":  
`ibmcloud cdb deployment-groups example-deployment`

To scale the memory to 2048 MB of RAM for each memory member of "example-deployment":  
`ibmcloud cdb deployment-groups-set member --memory 2048`ÃŸ

### Scaling via the API

The _Foundation Endpoint_ that is shown on the _Overview_ panel of your service provides the base URL to access this deployment through the API. Use it with the `/groups` endpoint if you need to manage or automate backups programmatically.

You can find more examples in the [API Reference](https://pages.github.ibm.com/compose/apidocs/apiv4doc-static.html#tag/Scaling).

## Setting the admin Password

To enable administrative access to your service, you have to set the admin password. You might also need to change the password of your service. You can do so by using _Update Password_.

A new, randomly generated password appears, or you can type your own password into the field. To regenerate another password, click the icon to the right of the field. When you click *Update Password*, you will be asked to confirm before the change is applied. 

**Note:** Changing the password changes the credentials that you or any other services that use the admin user to connect. It can cause these services to disconnect and experience downtime.
