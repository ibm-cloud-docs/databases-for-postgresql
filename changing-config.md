# Changing the PostgreSQL Configuration
{: #changing-configuration}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} allows you to change some of the PosgreSQL configuration settings so you can tune your PostgreSQL databases to your use-case. To make permanent changes to the database configuration, use the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} [cli-plugin](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-databases-cli-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration) or [API](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration) to write the changes to the configuration file for your deployment.

The configuration is defined in a schema. When you change the the configuration via the API or the CLI, you make changes to the configuration's JSON schema. To make a change, you make a JSON object with the settings and their new values. For example, to set the `max_connections` setting to 150, you would supply 
```
{"configuration":{"max_connections":150}}
```
to either the CLI or to the API.

## Using the CLI

To change your configuration through the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} cli-plugin, use `deployment-configuration` command. 
```
ibmcloud cdb deployment-configuration <deployment name or CRN> [@JSON_FILE | JSON_STRING]
```

The command reads the changes you would like to make from the JSON object or a file. For more information, see the [reference page](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-databases-cli-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration).

## Using the API

There are two deployment-configuration endpoints, one for viewing the configuration schema and one for changing the configuration. To view the configuration schema, send a `GET` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration/schema`.

To change the configuration, send the settings you would like to change as a JSON object in the request body of a `PATCH` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration)


## Available Configuration settings

### Memory Settings

[`shared_buffers`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS)
  - Default - `32000` (number of 8 KiB buffers, or about 262 MB) 
  - Restarts Database? - **Yes**
  - Options - The maximum amount of total space for `shared_buffers` is 8GB.
  - Notes - The number of 8 KiB shared memory buffers. For example, 1 GB of `shared_buffers` is 1048576 KiB, and
(1048576 KiB / 8 KiB) is `131072`. The recommended memory allocation for `shared_buffers` is 1/4 of the deployment's RAM. Setting `shared_buffers` any higher can result in memory issues leading to a database crash. Setting `shared_buffers` equal, close to equal, or higher than the amount of allocated memory will prevent the database from starting. 

### General Settings

[`max_connections`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-MAX-CONNECTIONS)
  - Default - 115
  - Restarts Database? - No
  - Notes - [You may need to scale before increasing max connections.](/docs/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-high-availability#connection-limits)

[`max_prepared_transactions`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAX-PREPARED-TRANSACTIONS)
  - Default - 0
  - Restarts Database? - No
  - Notes - The default value of `0` disables use of [prepared transactions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare-transaction.html) and is strongly recommended unless you need to use them.

[`synchronous_commit`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/wal-async-commit.html)
  - Default - `local`
  - Restarts Database? - No
  - Options - `local` or `off`
  - Notes - Setting `synchronous_commit` to `off` increases transaction commit rate at the expense of a loss of committed transactions in the event of an unclean shutdown.

[`effective_io_concurrency`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-EFFECTIVE-IO-CONCURRENCY)
  - Default - `12`
  - Restarts Database - No
  - Notes - It is recommended to leave this setting at the default. Only increase it you are have profiled SQL queries and have observed inefficient bitmap heap scans. As [IOPS are tied to disk size](/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-high-availability#disk-iops), increasing this on default or smaller sized disks is also not recommended.

[`deadlock_timeout`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-locks.html)
  - Default - 10000
  - Restarts Database - No
  - Options - Minimum value of 10
  - Notes - The number of milliseconds to wait before checking for deadlock and the duration where lock waits are logged. Logs available through the [logging integration](/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=cloud-databases-logging). Setting this too low negatively impacts performance.

`backup_retention_period`
  - Default - 30
  - Restarts Database - No
  - Notes - Adjust how many days deployment backups are retained. Deployments are provisioned with backup storage that equals the disk space. Increasing the number of days backups are retained increases the amount of storage they use and might [increase the cost of your deployment](/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-pricing#backups-pricing).
