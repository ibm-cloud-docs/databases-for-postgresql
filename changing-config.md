# Changing the PostgreSQL Configuration
{: #changing-configuration}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-postgresql_full}} allows you to change some of the PosgreSQL configuration settings so you can tune your PostgreSQL databases to your use-case. 
The configuration is defined in a schema. When you change the the configuration via the API or the CLI, you make changes to the configuration's JSON schema. To make a change, you make a JSON object with the settings and their new values. For example, to set the `max_connections` setting to 150, you would supply 
```
{"configuration":{"max_connections":150}}
```
to either the CLI or to the API.

## Using the CLI

To change your configuration through the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for}} cli-plugin, use `deployment-configuration` command. 
```
ibmcloud cdb deployment-configuration <deployment name or CRN> [@JSON_FILE | JSON_STRING]
```

The command reads the changes you would like to make from the JSON object or a file. For more information, see the [reference page](/docs/databases-cli-plugin?topic=cloud-databases-cli-cdb-reference#deployment-configuration).

## Using the API

There are two deployment-configuration endpoints, one for viewing the configuration schema and one for changing the configuration. To view the configuration schema, send a `GET` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration/schema`.

To change the configuration, send the settings you would like to change as a JSON object in the request body of a `PATCH` request to `/deployments/{id}/configuration`.

For more information, see the [API Reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloud-databases-api#change-your-database-configuration)
